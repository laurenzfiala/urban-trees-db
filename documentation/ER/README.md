# Usage of ER-Diagrams within this project

Diagrams are created with the freeware-tool ["Yed"](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).
It can also be used to view the *.graphml files.

__For ease of use, there should ALWAYS be a *.png image file, with the same name as the corresponding *.graphml, in the same directory.__
